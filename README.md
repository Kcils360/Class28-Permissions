  2. Create a policy for your new "admin" role
  3. Parse through your site and label your pages as needed either as [AllowAnonymous] or [Authorize] (with restrictions of policies or roles as appropriate/needed)
  4. Your applicaiton, upon completion of this lab should contain the following pages/behavior: 
    - Regular user registration page
    - Registration page for your new user role
    - Login page for both of these roles
    - Redirect the user to a different page dependent on their role
    - One page specific to your "Admin"
    - one page specific to your "non-admin" Roles (Not Home)
    - Home Page
  5. Be sure that each controller and action has a permissiions attributes associated with it.
